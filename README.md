**Abstract**

**Objectives**
We sought to determine the clinical presentations and ultrasonographic features of uterine fibroids in adult Ghanaians.

**Methods**
Between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2021, 4279 ultrasound-confirmed cases of uterine fibroids were retrieved. 
The data obtained, which included age, clinical presentations, and sonographic features were analyzed. 
A chi-squared test was done to assess for possible associations between the clinical indications, age
distribution, and ultrasonographic features of uterine fibroids.

**Results**
The mean age of the patients diagnosed with uterine fibroids was 37.1±11.5 years (range = 16–69 years). 
Routine checkup (n = 1310, 28.1%), menorrhagia (n = 1104, 23.7%), and lower abdominal mass (n = 801, 17.2%) 
were the leading clinical indications. Dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, menorrhagia, and routine checkup were 
significantly noted in the younger patients (p ≤ 0.001). The majority of the fibroid nodules had smooth 
regular outline (n = 4125, 96.4%) and were mostly heterogeneous (n = 3282, 76.7%). The echo pattern of the 
nodules was predominantly hypoechoic (n = 3358, 51.1%) followed by hyperechoic nodules (n = 2554, 38.9%). 
Degenerative changes accounted for less than one-third of the total fibroid nodules, with the least recorded 
degenerative change being nodules with cystic areas (n = 55, 5.4%) and the most observed degenerative feature 
being nodules with rim of calcification and areas of calcified degeneration (n = 965, 94.6%). Almost all the 
sonographic features were significantly seen in the 30–44 years age category.

**Conclusion**
Sonographically, uterine fibroids were mostly hypoechoic heterogeneous nodules with a smooth regular outline with
a predominant occurrence within women in the fourth to fifth decade of life.
